In this exercise we have optimize a window using scipy.optimize fuction.

We have 
* Created an error fuction which takes the randomly generated window of length 32 and gives the optimize window
* Plotted the impulse response and frequency response of optimized window
* Created an 8 band filter bank using the window and ideal low pass filter
* Applied the filter bank on audio signal
* Reconstructed the signal
* Plotted the original and reconstructed signal for comparison
